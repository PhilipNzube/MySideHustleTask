### What I learned
I learnt how to use css3 flexbox  and how to import font libraries with css

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
 <div id="social">
  <a href="" class="fa fa-facebook"></a>
  <a href="" class="fa fa-twitter"></a>
  <a href="" class="fa fa-instagram"></a>
  </div>
```
```css
@import
url('https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans');
@import
url('https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway');
```

### Continued development

i want to continue using css3 flexbox, font libraries and @media queries in my future projects


### Useful resources
